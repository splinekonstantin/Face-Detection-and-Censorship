**In order to use this application you need to use Chrome with enabled "Experimental Web Platform features" flag**

Allow access your webcam in order to check out this app.

Made by following @wesbos's course 'Beginner Javascript'.

Puts a censorship mask to your face by using FaceDetector API in Google chrome.

In this project I practiced my JavaScript skills. Learned working with canvas, adn used a package manager Parcel for the first time.
